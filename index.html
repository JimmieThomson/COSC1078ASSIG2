  <p>My name is James Thomson. I was born in February of 2003 in Edinburgh, Scotland while on a business trip with my family as my father studied medicine. My family comes from a highly mixed nationality; however, we primarily consist of Europeans. My education began in Kindergarten at glass street Kinder. Secondly, the primary school I attended from grade 1-4 was Kew East Primary; and lastly, my leading education was at Trinity Grammar School from grade 5-12. In VCE, I studied Physics, Methods, Chemistry, English and Software Development. I do not speak any languages apart from my native language English. </p>

    Primarily I am a big gamer spending all of my spare time playing (I'm addicted). Because of my immense enjoyment from playing, I have built a hobby around it and a hobby of making and building PCs for people in addition to programming and Servers. My main interest in IT began when I was young. I always enjoyed being near computers and electronics; I don't know why I have such enjoyment of these things, but it always gave me happiness. I believe it's because of how much I game on these devices. I've had a long experience with computers, servers, electronics, and hardware devices. I've built many PC's in my life and built servers for hosting windows users and/or gaming servers. I've made robots and programs for hardware and software simply because of the enjoyment of seeing a finished product.

    My interest in IT really sparked when I received my first computer, a HP Pavilion DV6. It was definitely not a state-of-the-art laptop, but it did the job. Soon after, I was introduced to the world of Minecraft by my older cousin, and together we ventured through many web-based games. I never got into console gaming, because my parents were not (and are still are not) fans of us playing video games. Therefore, my brother and I spent most of our time at our family friend’s place. There I was slightly introduced to the world of the PSP, The DSI, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and many other games. However, being the younger sister, I was strictly the observer and cannot say I have any particular skill playing any of these games.
