    <p><b>:The position and what makes it appealing to me</b></p>
    <p>My ideal job is a CIO or a ‘Chief Information Officer’. The role incorporates leadership through the combination of technology and business. The role requires me to manage senior leaders whilst bringing technological “thought” to the team. Thus, combining new and innovative ways to use technology within an already well established business. 
    </p>
    <p>The core of this role is the embedding of Information Technology business-wide, whilst also aiming to remove the blockades that can come from a lack thereof. Further, project management would mean taking charge of a team, striving them and bringing out the best in their abilities to ensure goals and deadlines are met.
    </p>
    <p>This role is appealing to me as I love implementing new technologies into my life everyday and continuously keeping up to date with them.

    <p><b>:The position and what makes it appealing to me</b></p>
    <p>For my ideal job I would love to end up being a project lead developer. Being a lead developer, I would be responsible for making and maintaining a team of talented individuals to help create new programs or technological solutions to the problems that we are given from our clients. The main draw that being a lead developer has on me is the ability to work on the technical aspects of a project, alongside working with our client to ensure that we are delivering a product that they are satisfied with. I believe this suits my abilities as someone with great professional communication and presentation skills, but as well as having a drive to be behind exciting and innovating technical achievements.

    <p>My ideal job is to be a software engineer in a big or small tech firm. That have predictable hours and a good workspace to be in. So, because of my interest in software programming as well as aviation I’ve found a job application. I’ve chosen the Qantas software developer advertisement as my ideal job application. The position is to develop code to suit the times and scheduling of flights and the cabin and crew for Qantas. The code must be written in python and used in addition to the domain-specific language rave, or as the information provided says, “development of applications that optimise the planning of flight and cabin crew schedules and rosters across the Qantas Group”. The skills required for this specific job application are the knowledge of in-depth Python coding language and the domain-specific RAVE to solve in-depth problems in planning and scheduling. The list says a person must have a degree in Software Development, IT or Aviation. I do not qualify for all of these. However, I have extensive experience in python and other languages such as C#, Java, C++ and Lua.
